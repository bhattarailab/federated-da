## A Server and Federated Clients Architecture for Cross-domain Surgical Image Segmentation

- This repository contains code for training the proposed federated learning architecture for image segmentation.
- The code trains the models(both encoder and decoder) from scratch on the given dataset.
- Make necessary changes in train.py file and follow the instructions on comments before finetuning the models as per the approach mentioned in the paper
